Busania Trading Management (BTM) features a straightforward logo design. The emblem comprises three candles progressively ascending, with the green color intensifying, symbolizing the continuous improvement of investments with BTM's support. This primary logo serves as the focal point for major brand promotions, ensuring consistent and easily recognizable branding across diverse platforms. It is imperative to adhere to the provided branding guide before deploying the logo.
